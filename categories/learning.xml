&lt;h2&gt;Why&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always wanted to blog, but I wanted to get something out of it. So, by writing about libraries
I use daily, I am trying to get to know those software better and be better in using it. Hopefully
I to discover some new parts that I do not know already, maybe I will even be able to contribute
to that part of the software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I consider myself still as programmer in learning and I will try to use this blog and the posts
about software to get better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="how"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will always start by writing something about the background of that lib.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why was it written?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What was the intention of the author?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who is the author? What else did he do?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I will do some small examples using that lib. While doing that I want to dive deeper into
that lib and understand what happens under the hood. This also can include running tests,
doing code style checks and examining the directory structure
`
By following that route I want to reveal the concepts/patterns behind each library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="how-the-technical-background"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How (the technical background)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog consists of static webpages, generated by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://getnikola.com"&gt;Nikola&lt;/a&gt;,
